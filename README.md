Here’s a version with your dry humor incorporated:

⸻

👋 Hi, I’m @coders33123
	•	👀 I’m interested in coding, machine learning, AI, and pretending I understand quantum physics.
	•	🌱 I’m currently learning Python, TensorFlow, and how to make my code look like it was written by a confused genius.
	•	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building something that could possibly change the world (or at least a few lines of code).
	•	📫 How to reach me? You can email me at coders33123@fakeemail.com, but let’s be honest, I’ll probably never check it.
	•	😄 Pronouns: He/They, but I respond better to ‘Hey, Coder’.
	•	⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to explain a bug to someone and ended up explaining the entire history of the internet instead.
